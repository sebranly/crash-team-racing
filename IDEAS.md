Team system (e.g. 4v4) with possibility to enable friendly-fire, with communication thanks to the HUD and fair map selection (maybe with maps that can be favorite-d) - 1
Be able to download other players' track ghosts (note: CNK already allowed you to save your reply as a single file, which you could share with another memory card) - 1
For competitive races, things like the Clock should only appear 2 times per race. - 1
Have options so you can play like the original game or with alternate rules - 1
Add Crash Bash as part of the deal - 2
Do not make the same mistake as the one that was made for Spyro regarding downloads - 2
The closest a story mode was in a Mario Kart game was Mario Kart DS' mission mode. - 2
Keep the skill based drift mechanics, that also requires track knowledge ; same goes for jumping boost mechanics - 2
Introduce some hovercraft capabilities like in CNK - 2
In CTR, the shield itself turned into a weapon which you could launch, but you had to launch use it before you could use anything else - how is it in CNK though? - 2
Get some elements from Spyro - 2
Vicarious Visions, who's behind the N.Sane Trilogy, also made Crash Nitro Kart back in 2003 - 2

Add new characters - 3
Maybe even add a level editor so players can make their own tracks - note: CNK has a poor one for battle arenas - 3
Have more cinematics - 3
No paid DLCs - 3
Add mascots from other playstation games; Sackboy, Ratchet & Clank, Sly Cooper - 3
VR support - 4
Spyro on his skateboard - 4

include other characters from the series like Koala Kong, N. Brio and Tawna - 7
Spyro with Sparx instead of Aku Aku or Uka Uka - 7

a playable Oxide - 16
investigate bug about Penta Penguin not getting the correct mask - 16
8-player split-screen game - 16
ability to leave traps in mid air - 16
think about out of bounds glitches - 16
check that in the trailer, Crash was shown using all the CNK team vehicles - 16
New track based on Crash 3 motorcycle levels - 16
Moto for Crash (like in Mario games) - 16
I thought that since Crash had appeared in Uncharted, Crash was being remade by Naughty Dog - 18 (+ include video of Boundary Breaks)
Nitrous just couldn't fit into memory for multiplayer, plus he was too big, so he got cut as a playable. - 18
include levels that didn't make it like the one mentioned "a short figure 8 track that was all ice" - 18
The control and collision was the disappointing part. They should have just used our original collision, it was right there, no work at all. - 18 (hoping they won't make the same mistake for CTR)
Only CTR, the N Oxide level was 3 times longer than the final version. - Isn't CNK super long as well? - 18
have fake crates as a joke so that hardcode fans know not to use them - 18
Light, quick acceleration, balanced and heavy. - 18
For microtransactions, only paid cosmetics - 19
If they could fix the "exploit" where you could just clash with someone, usually N.Gin cause he had the best gun, then just unclash from him right before the finish line to win, then sure, it was a unique game. - 21
The costumes were also a fun little bonus that I hope future Crash games include. - 21
CTR was the correct choice according to me and based on the demand I could read on the Internet - myself
having unlockable vehicles like in CTTR - 22
In CTTR, the tracks are completely forgettable in comparison to the ones from CTR, and even Nitro Kart. - 23
Maybe tiny elements of CTTR might enter a Crash Team Racing remake but that is it. - 23
Don't take personality (for characters) from CTTR because this is too much - 24
Spyro on DLC - 28
Especially Nina since the game could use more female racers and doesnt have any female villains. - 28
add time leaderboards - 34
Make so that multiple players can choose the same racer - 34
A level system for online as long as it doesn't turn into MTX - 35 (maybe based on chess)
intelligent voice chat system for online - 36
fix some visual details that matter (e.g. drifting on snow and it lets off these same pure black trails) but respect 100% the visual details (camera, smoke, etc) when drifting/boosting - 37
have Oxide Station playable in multiplayer mode (check it wasn't) - 37
check if Komodo Moe couldn't get paired with Komodo Joe because of limitations, and if so compare with boss in CNK that does something similar (Fenomena boss apparently) - 37
a hardcode AI for single player mode because it's too easy (except time trials that are already hard) - 37

One thing I also liked was the long tracks in MK8 that had a start and end - 42 (no different laps)
I'd like a Spyro track that went through multiple worlds like in the last race for CNK. Instead of the transition being in outer space like CNK, you'd be going through the hub world to reach the next portal. - 42
You can Choose between Drive your kart or go ON FOOT/Walking... (Reference to CTTR) in adventure mode - 42
in cnk you could not unlock the bosses - 42
CTTR wasn't on DS but it was supposed to - 44
Fasty - 45
include alternative modifications of tracks based on what ND couldn't do because of hardware limitations like the 4 turbos in Ox's station or the 4 entrances in the sewer level - 49
include the moon in Tiger Temple - 49
In Ngin's level, include huge yellow devices - 49
include a mirror mode/reverse mode - myself
out of time "sablier" that was removed: include it - 50
include thunder's struck waterfall from CNK - 50
PS2 version of CTTR didn't have 3-4 player mode but other versions (Xbox, Gamecube) had it - 52
we shouldnt have objects disappearing anymore (or a way higher limit) - myself
Insomniac Games was creating Crash Racing as well with Naughty Dog in 2010 - 57
Up to 16 characters like Crash Team Racing 2010 - 57
"A new way to keep you busy while racing was pulling off stunts in mid-air." - 57
CTR had a glitch to change the number of laps in the cups - 60
Optional handicap features and balance options are always welcome - 63
include pre-console mixes of soundtracks so we get the parts that were missing before - 65
The advanced power slide / boost capabilities need to be present (the "reserves," as well as the "yellow fire," and "sacred fire" techniques). Pro players will miss this greatly if this mechanic is removed - 70
There will be CNK tracks - 78
There will be additional outfits - 79
Where are the Trophy Girls - 79
There should be a really hard (difficult) mode for advanced players - 80
Bounce off of another player! Powerslide enough to spin out. Check if there is an option to switch off motion blur - 84

Explain with dates (february demo, PAX, GameStop) with differences e.g. feb was lacking tail and Gamestop too but not PAX ; GameStop had reserves but not february demo - myself
Hide a character in the map and finding him unlocks him, like Fake Crash in CNK - 131
